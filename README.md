### DATABASE
I created a Database using Docker that is based on the Postgres:latest image.

The name of the database is **"mydb"** with a table named **"users"**, it is structured like this:
![mydb](./img/mydb.png)

Using **DBeaver** as a client application to have an interface were we can see our Database.
